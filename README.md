# hangman_game.py

The purpose of this project was to exercise the relevent python tools and exercise a intermediate level of programming by using 
classes and OOP (object orientating programming) to create this game. Furthemore I was able to practice using list, dictionary and set functions which 
now has given me a good foundation of Python programming and now it can be implemented in later projects.
